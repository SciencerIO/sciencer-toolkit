## About
Sciencer Toolkit enables researchers to **programmatically conduct a literature review** using an intuitive yet flexible interface.

At its core, Sciencer collects sets of papers.
The initial set of papers is created through the use of **Collectors** (e.g. paper doi, author name).
Then, Sciencer iteratively finds new papers using **Expanders** (e.g. authors, citations, references).
Finally, new found papers need to satisfy a series of **Filters** in order to be accepted into the current set.
Being iterative in nature, Sciencer allows you to repeat the above steps has many times as you'd like.

This project was motivated by the absence of tools to automate systematic reviews using clear and well-defined criteria.
Still, for literature reviews that do not need to follow specific criteria, there are a several tools that can help to discover new papers.

## Usage

```python
# Create the Sciencer Core Component
sciencer = Sciencer()

# Define provider
sciencer.add_provider(SemanticScholarProvider())

# Define collectors
## this collector will gather all known papers authored by "John Doe" into de set
sciencer.add_collector(sciencer.collectors.CollectByAuthorID("John Doe"))
## this collector will collect the paper with DOI "1234567890" into the set
sciencer.add_collector(sciencer.collectors.CollectByDOI("1234567890"))
## this collector will collect the papers with 
sciencer.add_collector(sciencer.collectors.CollectByTerms(["Term 1", "Term 2", "Term 3"]))

# Define expanders
## this expander will gather all known papers written by authors in the current set.
sciencer.add_expander(sciencer.expanders.ExpandByAuthors())
## this expander will gather all the referenced papers
sciencer.add_expander(sciencer.expanders.ExpandByReferences())
## this expander will gather all the cited papers
sciencer.add_expander(sciencer.expanders.ExpandByCitations())

# Define filters
## this filter will reject papers that were published before 2010 and after 2030
sciencer.add_filter(sciencer.filters.FilterByYear(min_year=2010, max_year=2030))
## this filter will reject all the appers that do not have the word social on the abstract
sciencer.add_filter(sciencer.filters.FilterByAbstract("social"))

# Run one iteration
results = sciencer.iterate()

```
